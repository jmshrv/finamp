Note: The F-Droid release may take a day or two to get updates because since [F-Droid only builds once a day](https://www.f-droid.org/en/docs/FAQ_-_App_Developers/#ive-published-a-new-release-why-is-it-not-in-the-repository).

The app is also available as an APK from the [releases page](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/releases).
